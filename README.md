# tap-tester
Integration testing framework for Singer taps.

## To Document:

1. StandardTests usage example
2. BaseTest subclassing requirements and example
  - E.g., "You must implement these things because..." for things like `config_environment`
3. Purpose for the library
4. Contribution and Vision
  - Should be clean interface
  - Should use standards for cross-platform Python (e.g., use os.linesep instead of `\n`, and so on.
5. Testing advice (what makes a good tap-tester test?)
